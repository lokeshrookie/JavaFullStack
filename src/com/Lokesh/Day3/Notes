Ararys:

1. In 2D array, arr.length == no of rows not columns.
2. Jagged Array: In a 2D array, if every row do not have the same number of columns(elements), then called Jagged Array.
3.

Strings:
    1. String is a sequence of characters and  stored in the form of Objects.(not stored as arrays.)
    2. String without new keyword will be stored in "String pool". String with new keyword will be stored in "Heap Memory".
    3. String Constant Pool do not contain duplicates. So if we create a new String object with the same content.
        Then new reference will be added to the original Object. New object will not be created.
